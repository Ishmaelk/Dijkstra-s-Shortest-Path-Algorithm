# Dijkstra-s-Shortest-Path-Algorithm
Implementation of Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm. Use make all to compile and ./FindPaths &lt;graph_file> &lt;starting_vertex> to run, where graph file is a graph input file like those provided and starting_vertex is an integer representing a vertex in the graph file.
